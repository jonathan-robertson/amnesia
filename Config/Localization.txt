amnesiaJournalTip,Journal Tip,,"Survivors are reporting strange occurrences of Amnesia when experiencing severe trauma... At level [007fff]{cvar(amnesiaLongTermMemoryLevel)}[-] and beyond, becoming incapacitated will result in a [ff8000]Fragile Memory[-]. This [ff8000]Fragile Memory[-] will cause full-blown [ff007f]Memory Loss[-] if you were to become incapacitated once more.\n\n[ff8000]This Happens Every Time I Die?[-]\nDying will impact memory, but there are a few exceptions: if [00ff80]another player kills you[-], or if [00ff80]you die during Blood Moon for any reason[-].\n\n[ff8000]What Would I Forget Due to Memory Loss?[-]\nYou will forget your level, learned skills, and unspent skill points (you'll be reset back to level [007fff]{cvar(amnesiaLongTermMemoryLevel)}[-] and can reallocate the skillpoints you would've had at that level).\n\n[ff8000]Will I Remember Anything After Memory Loss?[-]\nYou will never forget schematics, books, items/equipment (backpack is dropped on ground, but not deleted), vehicles, map, waypoints, land claims, bedroll location, quests, trader relationships.\n\n[ff8000]How Can I Recover From a Fragile Memory?[-]\nYou'll find that all traders sell a new item called [007fff]Trader Jen's Memory Boosters[-] in limited quantities, which you can use to recover from a [ff8000]Fragile Memory[-]. This will give you a buffer against memory loss, but the sale price is also quite high; you probably won't be able to afford it right away.\n\n[ff8000]Anything Else I Should Know?[-]\nDefeating certain powerful zombies will lift your spirits, providing a timed boost of double xp for you and everyone else on the server! Try to take these challenging enemies down for the benefit and relief of the entire community."

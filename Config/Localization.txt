amnesiaJournalTip,Journal Tip,,"Survivors are reporting strange occurrences of Amnesia when experiencing severe trauma...\n\nAfter reaching level [007fff]{cvar(amnesiaLongTermMemoryLevel)}[-], becoming incapacitated will result in a [ff8000]Fragile Memory[-]. This [ff8000]Fragile Memory[-] will cause full-blown [ff007f]Memory Loss[-] if you were to become incapacitated once more.\n\nWhat Would I Forget Due to [ff007f]Memory Loss[-]?\nYou will forget your level, learned skills, and unspent skill points (you'll be reset back to level [007fff]{cvar(amnesiaLongTermMemoryLevel)}[-] and can reallocate the skillpoints you would've had at that level).\n\nWill I Remember Anything After [ff007f]Memory Loss[-]?\nYou will never forget schematics, books, items/equipment (backpack is dropped on ground, but not deleted), vehicles, map, waypoints, land claims, bedroll location, quests, trader relationships.\n\nHow Can I Recover From a [ff8000]Fragile Memory[-]?\nYou'll find that all traders sell a new item called [007fff]Trader Jen's Memory Booster[-] in limited quantities, which you can use to recover from a [ff8000]Fragile Memory[-]. This will give you a buffer against memory loss, but the sale price is also quite high; you probably won't be able to afford it right away.\n\n?\nDying will impact memory, but there are a few exceptions: if [00ff80]another player kills you[-], or if [00ff80]you die during Blood Moon for any reason[-].\n\nAnything Else?\nDefeating certain powerful zombies will lift your spirits, providing a timed boost of double xp for you and everyone else on the server! Try to take these challenging enemies down for the benefit and relief of the entire community."

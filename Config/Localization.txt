amnesiaJournalTip,Journal Tip,,"This server is configured so that players 'forget' certain kinds of progress after dying [ff8000]{cvar(amnesiaMaxLives)}[-] times. You can view your Remaining Lives by going to the Character tab and selecting Core Character Stats.\n\n[ff007f]Forgotten[-]: levels, learned skills, unspent skill points, and Player Stats related to zombie/player kills as well as times died.\n\n[00ff80]Never Forgotten[-]: learned schematics, books, items/equipment (backpack is dropped on ground, but not deleted), vehicles, map, waypoints, land claims, bedroll location, quests, trader relationships.\n\n[00ff80]Recovering a Life[-]: All traders sell Smelling Salts in limited quantities, which you can use to recover a single life. This item is quite expensive, so you probably won't be able to afford it right away.\n\n[00ff80]Safe PVP[-]: You will NOT lose any lives if another player kills you, but you will lose 1 life if you die for any other reason (zombies, suicide, gravity, traps).\n\n[00ff80]Safe Blood Moon[-]: You will NOT lose any lives during Blood Moon, regardless of what kills you (or even if you kill yourself). Focus instead on safely gaining levels during this hectic event.\n\n[00ff80]Positive Outlook[-]: Forgetting all your negative experiences from before will leave you feeling strangely positive about the future! Double XP for up to 1 hour will help you to quickly get back on your feet."

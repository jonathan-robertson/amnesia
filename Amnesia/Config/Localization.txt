amnesiaJournalTip,Journal Tip,,"This server is configured so that players 'forget' certain kinds of progress after dying [ff8000]{cvar(amnesiaMaxLives)}[ffffff] times. You can view your Remaining Lives by going to the Character tab and selecting Core Character Stats.\n\n[ff007f]Forgotten[ffffff]: levels, learned skills, unspent skill points, and Player Stats related to zombie/player kills as well as times died.\n\n[00ff88]Never Forgotten[ffffff]: learned schematics, books, items/equipment (backpack is dropped on ground, but not deleted), vehicles, map, waypoints, land claims, bedroll location, quests, trader relationships.\n\n[00ff88]Recovering a Life[ffffff]: All traders sell Smelling Salts in limited quantities, which you can use to recover a single life. This item is quite expensive, so you probably won't be able to afford it right away.\n\n[00ff88]Safe PVP[ffffff]: You will NOT lose any lives if another player kills you, but you will lose 1 life if you die for any other reason (zombies, suicide, gravity, traps).\n\n[00ff88]Positive Outlook[ffffff]: Forgetting all your negative experiences from before will leave you feeling strangely positive about the future! Double XP for up to 1 hour will help you to quickly get back on your feet."
